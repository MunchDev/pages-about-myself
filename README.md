# pages-about-myself

This repository hosts the website thaibinh.me

## Project structure

- `_data` contains some personal information that can be used across posts and pages. It also supports
localisation, though I have no such intention, *haha*.

- `_draft`, like the name, contains draft posts/pages/projects that are not ready to be published.

- `_featured_categories` defines categories, which then can be added as a tag in front matter.

- `_posts` contains all blog posts published on the site.

- `_projects` contains, *well*, projects - a collection of posts and pages that are related.

- `assets` contains non-code information, like images, PDFs and other additional CSS stuff.

- `_includes`, `_js`, `_layouts`, `_sass` contains the HTML template and CSS code particular to the theme.

All other files and folders are required to set up the build environment of the site.
