Welcome to `thaibinh.me`!

This is my personal website, used primarily for portfolio presentation, but sometimes I will add one or two
blog posts on tips in programming.

Please note that `thaibinh.me` is under active development at the moment, so *most of the information* is
rather missing or incomplete. Please forgive me and I'll try to finish things up soon!

That's it for the homepage. If you're interested, you can read my blog posts [here](blog/)!

Additionally, if you're interested in the source code behind this entire website, you can visit the
repository [here](https://github.com/MunchDev/pages-about-myself)
