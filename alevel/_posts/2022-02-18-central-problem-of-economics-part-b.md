By the end of this learning package, you will be able to:

* identify the three economic agents involved in making decisions regarding resource allocation;

* identify the three economic agents involved in making decisions regarding resource allocation;

* understand the decision-making approach in relation to the central problem of economics; and

* explain the marginalist approach to weighing benefits and costs.

## The Marginalist Principle

In Economics, economic agents are expected to make choices using a marginalist approach to weigh
costs and benefits.

To understand their decision-making process, we must first understand their objectives:

* Consumers want to maximise *utility* - the level of satisfaction derived from consumption of
goods and services.

* Producers want to maximise *profit*.

* Government wants to maximise *social welfare*.

### Deep dive: What does 'Marginal' mean?

Marginal refers to *one more* or an *additional* unit.

Marginal benefit refers to the benefit of making the decision to get *one more unit*, while
marginal cost refers to the cost of such decision.

In Economics, economic agents aim to achieve the point where marginal cost is equal to
marginal benefit.

### Deep dive: Rational decision-making

A rational decision-maker will:

* do *more* of an activity when the marginal benefits of an action exceed its marginal costs.

* do *less* of an activity when the marginal costs of an action exceed its marginal benefits.

When marginal benefits are equal to marginal costs, the satisfaction level is said to have
maximised.

### Marginal benefit

The marginal benefit of an activity is the increase in total benefit that results from carrying out
one additional unit of the activity.

The consumers care about *marginal utility*, the producers care about *marginal profits*, and the
government cares about *marginal social benefits*.

### Marginal cost

The Marginal Cost of an activity is the increase in the total costs that results from carrying out
one additional unit of the activity.

The consumers care about *marginal cost of purchasing one more unit of good*, the producers care
about *marginal cost of production*, and the government cares about *marginal social costs*.

## The Decision-Making Framework

Recall the goals of economic agents:

> * Consumers want to maximise *utility*.
> * Producers want to maximise *profit*.
> * Government wants to maximise *social welfare*.

In reality, economic agents make rational decisions based on more than just cost and benefit.
There are various considerations to take into account as well. The Framework is captured in the
image below:

![The Decision-Making Framework](../../../assets/img/alevel/econ-dmf.jpg)

The considerations are:

1. Constraints

    Contrainsts determine the choices available. Economic agents, hence, decide on the best-ranked
    choice to maximise their interest, *assuming they are rational*.

2. Cost and Benefits

    Economic agents must consider both monetary and non-monetary costs and benefits when making
    decisions. One example would be the *opportunity cost*. In this case, agents need to make a
    decision that offers *the maximum net benefit*.

    One useful tool to arrive at the best choice is the Marginalist Principle. It helps agents to
    decide whether to continue or stop the existing activity.

3. Information

    Agents have to gather information to weigh costs and benefits of every available choice.

4. Perspectives

    When a decision is made, it could have both intended and unintended consequences. When changes
    occur, agents might need to go through the decision-making process as well.

5. Intended & Unintended Consequences

    *Intended consequences* of an economic decision are assumed to occur because economists assume
    rational behaviour and economic conditions remain unchanged.

    *Unintended consequences* refer to the outcomes that are not anticipated in the economic
    decision. This might occur because economic agents may not have made their decisions under
    perfect information conditions, due to an inability to have access to complete information
    or when economic conditions change.

6. Changes

    The aims, constraints, costs, benefits, information and perspectives of economic agents can
    change over time. When changes occur, the economic decision undertaken by an agent may no
    longer be optimal, calling for a revisit of the decision-making process to ensure that the
    intended outcomes can be achieved.

### Decision-making by Consumers

Consumers need to consider to available choices due to their constraints, i.e. monetary budget.
For example, a couple have enough money for a 4-seater car, but not a 7-seater one.

They also need to weigh the costs and benefits of such decision. For example, the benefits of
owning a car includes the convenience, the satisfaction, etc. But there are also costs involved,
like prices and taxes, insurance, parking, fuel, etc.

Consumers will need more information so that they can make better decision. They also need to
take into account of other stakeholders's perspective. For example, a couple needs to consult
one another, or even their children.

They also need to consider consequences, especially unintended ones. For example, this could be
a car accident. Additionally, they will need to make changes if necessary.

### Decision-making by Producers

Likewise, producers have many important decisions to make. For example, they need to consider
what factors of production to use, what suppliers to engage, etc. to yield the maximum profit.

They also need to research the market, including their competitions, so that they can strategise
better. For example, let's consider the decision to raise prices or not.

The main objective of the decision is to increase the revenue, *if the consumers are willing to
pay for the increased prices*. This could have an unintended consequence: consumers might want
to buy goods for the competition, leading to lower sale and even lower revenue.

As such, the producers need to think about how consumers and other producers react to the change
in prices. The decision could also impact the larger society and this could prompt the government
to intervene.

### Decision-making by Governments

Governments need to consider the needs of the greater society. As such, even what seems like the
simplest problem could turn out to be extremely difficult to solve.

The Government intervenes when market outcomes are not deemed to be optimal by society's
standard. They also make decisions at both microeconomic level as well as macroeconomic level.

Hence, the economic goal of the Government is to achieve the highest level of social welfare.

#### Difference in decision-making compared to other economic agents

1. Social Welfare versus Individual Interest

    Governments are concerned about social welfare of the overall society, while consumers and
    producers are driven by self-interest.

2. Degree of Impact: Wide ranging or Limited impact

    Governments' decisions tend to affect all other economic agents, whether they are short-
    or long-term. In contrast, decisions made by other agents affect a relatively smalle
    proportion of population.

3. Information

    Governments need a lot more information compared to others, as their decisions are extremely
    consequential.

4. Positive and Normative Economics

    Governments require both positive and normative economics. For example, data will show how much
    governments need to subsidise healthcare in order to achieve a certain target. However, the
    question of *how much* depends on other stakeholders, as such, different countries have different
    policies for the same issue they face.
