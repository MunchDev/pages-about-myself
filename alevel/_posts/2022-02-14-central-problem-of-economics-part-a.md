## Introduction to Economics

### What is Economics?

Economics is a social science that studies how individuals and societies tackle _the problem of scarcity_,
having to allocate _scarce resources_ among _unlimited wants_.

As a result, some wants are fulfilled, while some aren’t. Hence, choosing one over another leads to
_trade-offs_: the forgoing giving up of alternative uses of resources.

For example, Singapore has a severe scarcity of land. As such, for a certain location, a housing unit might be
more desirable, but most likely angers elderly people, who want more medical facilities, and parents, who want
more schools for their children.

### Microeconomics versus Macroeconomics

Microeconomics is the study of economic behaviour of individual and businesses in different markets, for
example, the smartphone market, the energy market, etc.

Macroeconomics is the study of the economy as a whole, focusing on aggregate characteristics and economy-wide
factors such as interest rate, inflation, growth and unemployment at the national level.

### Positive economics and Normative economics

Positive economics is the branch that describes economic phenomena, focusing on facts and cause-and-effect
behavioural relationships and includes the development and testing of economic theories. It is sometimes
referred to as value-free economics.

Normative economics is the branch that expresses value judgements about economic fairness or what the outcome
of the economy and policy measure might be.

Positive economics is concerned with the development and testing of positive statements about the world that
are objective and verifiable. Normative statements derive from an opinion or a point of view. Thus the words
'should', 'ought to' or 'it is better to' frequently occur.

### Economic Resources - What are the 4 Factors of Production?

Economic resources, aka factors of production, are input used in the production of goods and services.

The four major categories are Capital, Entrepreneurial, Land, and Labour.

Capital resources include man-made resources, such as factories, machinery, and tools.

Entrepreneurial resources refer to the factor that takes overall responsibility of decision-making and risks
of a business.

Land resources refer to the physical space and the resources that are attached to it, such as animals, plants,
natural resources, etc.
Labour resources refer to people, including their skills and strengths. The quantity of labour resources
consists of all people in an economy that are able and willing to work.

The returns paid to C.E.L.L are called interests, profits, rent, and wages, respectively.

## Scarcity, Choice & Opportunity Cost

### Scarcity

The central problem faced by all economists is the problem of scarcity.

Scarcity is the problem that arises because limited resources cannot fully satisfy unlimited wants.

All societies face scarcity. As long as there is anyone whose wants are not completely fulfilled, scarcit
exists.

Hence, there is a need to make choices.

### Choice

The limited resources have alternative uses - the same resource can be used to produce a variety of goods,
hence the need to make choices.

Economic agents face the problem of scarcity, hence need to make choices to satisfy unlimited wants.

### Opportunity Cost

Whenever a decision is made, an opportunity cost is incurred.

Opportunity cost is the net benefit that could have been derived from the next best alternative forgone as a
result of a decision made.

Moral story: Free things aren’t free. For example, if I spent 1 week queuing up for a free iPhone, the
opportunity cost would be what I could do with that 1 week instead.
