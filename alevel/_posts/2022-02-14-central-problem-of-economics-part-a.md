## Introduction to Economics

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

* understand the central economic problem of scarcity;

* identify why trade-offs occur;

* be aware of the concepts of microeconomics and macroeconomics;

* be aware of the concepts of positive and normative economics; and

* identify the four different types of economic resources.

### What is Economics?

_Economics is a social science that studies how individuals and societies tackle the problem of_
_scarcity, having to allocate scarce resources among unlimited wants._

As a result, some wants are fulfilled, while some aren’t. Hence, choosing one over another leads
to _trade-offs_: the forgoing giving up of alternative uses of resources.

For example, Singapore has a severe scarcity of land. As such, for a certain location, a housing
unit might be more desirable, but most likely angers elderly people, who want more medical
facilities, and parents, who want more schools for their children.

### Microeconomics versus Macroeconomics

_Microeconomics is the study of economic behaviour of individual and businesses in different markets,_
_for example, the smartphone market, the energy market, etc._

Macroeconomics is the study of the economy as a whole, focusing on aggregate characteristics and
economy-wide factors such as interest rate, inflation, growth and unemployment at the national level.

### Positive economics and Normative economics

Positive economics is the branch that describes economic phenomena, focusing on facts and
cause-and-effect behavioural relationships and includes the development and testing of economic
theories. It is sometimes referred to as value-free economics.

Normative economics is the branch that expresses value judgements about economic fairness or what
the outcome of the economy and policy measure might be.

Positive economics is concerned with the development and testing of positive statements about the
world that are objective and verifiable. Normative statements derive from an opinion or a point of
view. Thus the words 'should', 'ought to' or 'it is better to' frequently occur.

### Economic Resources - What are the 4 Factors of Production?

_Economic resources, aka factors of production, are input used in the production of goods and_
_services._

The four major categories are Capital, Entrepreneurial, Land, and Labour.

Capital resources include man-made resources, such as factories, machinery, and tools.

Entrepreneurial resources refer to the factor that takes overall responsibility of decision-making
and risks of a business.

Land resources refer to the physical space and the resources that are attached to it, such as
animals, plants, natural resources, etc.

Labour resources refer to people, including their skills and strengths. The quantity of labour
resources consists of all people in an economy that are able and willing to work.

The returns paid to C.E.L.L are called interests, profits, rent, and wages, respectively.

## Scarcity, Choice & Opportunity Cost

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

* explain why scarcity exists;
* give examples of choices that different economic agents have to make; and
* understand the concept of opportunity cost.

### Scarcity

The central problem faced by all economists is the problem of scarcity. _Scarcity is the problem_
_that arises because limited resources cannot fully satisfy unlimited wants._

All societies face scarcity. As long as there is anyone whose wants are not completely fulfilled,
scarcity exists. Hence, there is a need to make choices.

### Choice

The limited resources have alternative uses - the same resource can be used to produce a variety of
goods, hence the need to make choices.

Economic agents face the problem of scarcity, hence need to make choices to satisfy unlimited wants.

### Opportunity Cost

Whenever a decision is made, an opportunity cost is incurred.

_Opportunity cost is the net benefit that could have been derived from the next best alternative_
_forgone as a result of a decision made._

Moral story: Free things aren’t free. For example, if I spent 1 week queuing up for a free iPhone,
the opportunity cost would be what I could do with that 1 week instead.

## The Production Possibility Curve (PPC)

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

* explain what the PPC is;

* use the PPC to illustrate the concepts of scarcity, choice and opportunity cost; and

* explain the factors causing shifts in the PPC.

### What the PPC illustrates

_The Production Possibility Curve shows the maximum attainable combinations of two goods that can be_
_produced by an economy within a specified period of time with all its resources fully and_
_efficiently employed, at a given state of technology._

Meaning, each point of the curve represents a possible output of two types of goods that can be
produced optimally.
{:.note}

The PPC assumes that:

* Only two goods are being produced with all available resources;

* There is a fixed amount of resources that are fully and efficiently used; and

* The level of technology is fixed within the given time period (Technology is the state of
knowledge of available techniques of production).

The PPC has a concave shape around the origin. This represents the fact that as more of a
particular type of goods is produced, the additional resources taken will not be as optimally
utilised as compared to producing the other type of goods.

Optimally, a economy should produce at a point on the PPC, as it represents resources being fully
utilised.

#### How the PPC illustrates Scarcity, Choice & Opportunity Cost

* Scarcity

  The economy, due to unlimited wants, wants to produce at a point _outside the PPC_, where it
  would mean that more goods will be produced. However, any point outside the PPC is unattainable,
  given the current amount of resources and state of technology.

  Hence, such points illustrate the problem of __scarcity__, as they represent the points where
  the economy wants to produce but is unable to do so because of limited resources.

  In the PPC example above, Y is one such point.

* Choice

  When the economy is producing optimally, it can produce a variety of combinations of goods on
  the PPC. However, it is _forced to choose one, among all points on the PPC_. This illustrates the
  concept of __choice__.

  Additionally, the need to __choose__ also illustrate the concept of __scarcity__, as the economy
  cannot produce all simultaneously.

  In the PPC example above, A, B, C, D, and E represents such points to choose from.

* Opportunity cost

  The concept of __opportunity cost__ is illustrated by __the downward-sloping nature__ of the PPC,
  where in order to produce more of one good, the economy must forgo the net benefit derived from
  the production of the other good.

  Assuming all resources in the economy are fully employed, if an economy chooses to produce more
  goods A, it will have to sacrifice the production of goods B. The amount of goods B's production
  forgone as an additional unit of good A is produced is the opportunity cost of producing that
  unit of good A.

  In the PPC example above, assuming the country is producing at point B. If it decides to produce
  one more machine, i.e. move to point C, it would mean that 6 units of food will need to be
  sacrificed to produce 1 unit of machine. Hence, the opportunity cost of increasing the production
  of machines from 2 to 3 units is 6 units of food.

### The Shape of the PPC

As explained earlier, the PPC can also illustrate the concept of increasing opportunity cost. This
means that an increasing amount of one good has to be given up to produce additional units of
another good. This is illustrated by the shape of the PPC that is concave to the origin.

Increasing opportunity cost reflects that some resources are better suited to the production of
certain goods rather than others. This is because resources are not homogenous (i.e. they are
imperfect substitutes), i.e. they are not equally efficient in the production of all goods.

### General Model of the PPC

![A General Model of the PPC](../../../assets/img/alevel/econ-general-ppc.png)

The figure above shows a general model of the PPC, where capital goods and consumer goods represent
two types of goods a country can produce.

Consumer goods have _no future productive use_ and are _used directly by the consumers_, such as
mobile phones, cars, etc. to satisfy _current_ wants.

On the other hand, capital goods help increase the productive capacity of a country. They determine
the capacity to produce for future consumption, like equipments that are used to produce consumer
goods.

Recall that capital goods are factors of production.
{:.note}

### Causes of an Outward Shift of the PPC

* Increase in the quantity of resources available

Any increase in the quantity of capital, labour, land or entrepreneurship will lead to an outward
shift of the PPC as more resources mean more goods can be produced.

For example, the discovery of crude oil reserve can leads to increase production of oil in a
country.

* Improvement in the quality of resources

An increase in the quality of resources implies an improvement in the productivity of resources.
E.g. an increase in labour productivity (i.e. output per labour hour), could be a result of higher
levels of education by the population. With resources becoming more productive, more goods can be
produced given the same amount of resources. This would hence lead to an outward shift of the PPC.

* Improvement in technology

Any technological improvement that results in new or better methods of production will cause the
PPC to shift outwards. This is because new or better methods allow producers to produce more of
any given good using current resources more efficiently, productivity increases and this causes
the PPC to shift outwards.

### Types of Shifts of the PPC

* Parallel shift

The PPC will undergo a parallel shift if a positive change in any of the above factors is able to
enhance the production of both goods equally.

![Example of parallel shift of PPC](../../../assets/img/alevel/econ-ppc-parallel-shift.png)

* Pivoted shift

The PPC will undergo a pivoted shift if a positive change in any of the above factors is able to
enhance the production of one good more than the other.

![Example of pivoted shift of PPC](../../../assets/img/alevel/econ-ppc-pivoted-shift.png)

### Economic Growth and the PPC

_Economic growth is the increase in the real output of an economy over a period of time._

There are, in fact, two types:

* Actual economic growth is the percentage annual increase in national output.

* Potential economic growth is the percentage annual increase in the economy’s capacity to produce.

Moreover, on the PPC,

* Actual economic growth represents the movement from a point _within_ the PPC to a point _on
or closer_ to the PPC.

![Example of actual economic growth](../../../assets/img/alevel/econ-ppc-aeg.gif)

* Potential economic growth represents the _outward shift_ of the PPC.

![Example of potential economic growth](../../../assets/img/alevel/econ-ppc-peg.gif)

As such, one way a country can achieve potential economic growth over time is by producing more
capital goods. A greater amount of capital goods would enable an economy to produce larger
quantities of consumer goods, or to produce them at a lower cost than existing methods currently
permit.

For example, increasing the production of equipment such as machinery in the current time period
allows an economy to produce more consumer goods in the future.
{:.note}

#### Current Standard of Living versus Future Standard of Living

_Standard of Living refers to the well-being of an average person in a country._

Economies often must decide whether to allocate more resources towards the production of capital
goods or consumer goods to increase the standard of living in an economy.

* More capital goods result in higher potential economic growth, improving _future standard of living_.
It also means that less consumer goods being produced at the moment, lowering _current standard of_
_living_.

An opportunity cost is incurred: A reduction in the current standard of living.

* In contrast, more consumer goods increase _current standard of living_. It also means that less
capital goods being produced, lowering potential economic growth and resulting in a reduction in the
_future standard of living_.

An opportunity cost is incurred: A reduction in the future standard of living.

### Efficiency and the PPC

There are two types of efficiency:

* _Productive efficiency is achieved when the maximum output is produced for a given amount of_
_inputs, or a given output is produced at the least possible cost._

* _Allocative efficiency is achieved when the society produces and consumes a combination of goods_
_that maximises its welfare. It occurs when goods and services wanted by society are produced_
_in the right quantities._

All points on the PPC represent productive efficiency, while only one of them represents allocative
efficiency.
